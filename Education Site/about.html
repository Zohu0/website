                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means
                    helping
                    people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also
                    important for
                    educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to
                    make it
                    better.

                    Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation
                    to
                    generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest
                    and
                    effective citizen.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                    knowledge
                    and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally
                    and through
                    imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As
                    cultures
                    began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation,
                    formal
                    education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom</p>
